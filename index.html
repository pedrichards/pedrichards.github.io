      I was born in Lawrence, Ma and raised in Windham, NH. Special childhood interests were sports, particularly soccer, and nature. We traveled as a family, twice to the West Coast, and once to Europe. After graduating middle school, I was enrolled at Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua, NH, where I made four year honor-role, and captained the tennis team my senior year. I graduated after being admitted and deciding to attend Boston College, in Chestnut Hill, Ma. 
      I developed, in high school, an interest in music. It was then I attended the first concerts of my choice. I saw the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, U2, The Eagles. I was also a huge fan of Led Zeppelin and The Clash. At Boston College, after considering economics as a path of study, I decided, finally, to study English. I tried out early, but only made the club soccer team as a Junior. Second semester of my junior year, after a year of living off-campus as is the norm for juniors at that school, I embarked on a trip to study abroad, in a program run by a department at SUNY Plattsburg, at the Universidad de Playa Ancha, in Valparaiso, Chile. After graduating with a 3.27 GPA and a major in English, I returned to my parents' house for a year, and applied, that fall to masters in architecture programs at Columbia's GSAPP and The Art Institute of Chicago's newly formed AIADO. I studied there for a year and a half, and found it wasn't the right fit for me. Later, I remained in Chicago, IL, living in the Logan Square neighborhood, and immersed myself in freelance work and bicycle mechanics. I developed a hobby of collecting rocks, and searching for meteorites there, which I thought glaciation had brought together at that locale historically.
